Description: MixTwice is a R package for large-scale hypothesis testing. It takes two statistics per testing unit -- an  estimated effect and its associated standard error -- and fits a nonparametric, shape-constrained mixture separately on two latent parameters. It   reports local false discovery rates (lfdr) and local false sign rates (lfsr).
