### GTEx project

The data consists of 20 samples from two regions of the human basal ganglia, the nucleus accumbens and the putamen from the GTEx project.

We can download the data from https://zenodo.org/record/1475409/files/rnaseq-brain-counts.rds?download=1 and the data is saved as GTEx_raw data.RData in this reporsitory.

### mir-200 project

The second data set tests for differences in gene expression upon the knockout of the microRNA mir-200c (Kim et al., 2013). The raw fastq files can be found under the accession number SRP030475.
