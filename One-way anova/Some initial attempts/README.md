## Verification of non-null distribution of F statistic

In the Bayesian framework, we need to calculate the sampling distribution for between sum of squares (SSB), within sum of squares (SSE) or their ratio, F statistic, under the general case.

It is well-known that under the null distribution, F statistic follows F distribution with certain degree of freedoms. This directory is to summarize and verify (via simulation) the non-null sampling distribution of those statistics.
