## Data example

This is the directory for Data example. We would like to evaluate the performance of:

1. Number of positives.
2. Reproducibility, as described in Zheng 2021, Bioinformatics.

We collect data from two independent peptide array studies. The first array contains 5 groups (CCP+RF+, CCP+RF-, CCP-RF+, CCP-RF-, control) with 12 subjects each; the second array contains 7 disease groups (Mild lupus, Severe lupus, AS, CCP+RF+, CCP-RF-, SSj-, SSj+) with 8 subjects each and another 16 controls (each control is corresponded with one or multiple disease groups).

As the one-way ANOVA setting, it would be interesting to evaluate the following group:

1. RA+ vs RA- vs control. 
2. Mild lupus vs Severe lupus vs control.
3. SSj+ vs SSj- vs control.

For the first comparison, we can also evaluate the reproducibility since the samples from CCP+RF+RA and CCP-RF-RA group were collected in both independent array studies.
