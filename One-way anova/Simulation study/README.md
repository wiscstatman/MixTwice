## Simulation study

This is the directory for simulation study. We would like to evaluate the performance of:

1. pi0 estimation under different scenarios of alternative distributions.
2. FDR control and power

Here summarizes the list of methods we would like to compare and evaluate the operating characters:

0. MixTwice-ANOVA
1. Bonferroni correction
2. BH approach, Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995
3. Storey's q-value, Storey, 2006
4. Conditional local FDR (LFDR), Cai and Sun, 2009
5. IHW, Ignatiadis et al, 2016
6. Boca and Leek's FDR regression (BL), Boca and Leek, 2017
7. Adaptive p-value thresholding (AdaPT), Lei and Fithiam, 2018
